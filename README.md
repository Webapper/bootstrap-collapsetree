# Bootstrap Collapse-tree
A minimal modification of original BS3 collapse plugin for support collapsing tree-structures

It also supports a custom `selected.bs.collapse` event to be listened when a record selected by mouse click or tap. I recommend you to first getting know of how to use original Collapse plugin, then take a try with my Collapse-tree. A good point for starting is to play and fork my demo which is linked below.

## Working demo
As this JS component is very light-weight I don't want to add more than a simple demo, you can find the sources and try it in work on Bootply: http://www.bootply.com/0nnE3uFVXI
